I was assigned to the Latgale artillery corps which was stationed at Krustpils. On arrival there were about 1000 new recruits, we were lined up and divided into batteries. First all the university students were called out, then those that completed high school and those who had not completed high school. Then tradesmen and other workers were called. I applied as a milk factory bookkeeper and was assigned to headquarters as a bookkeeper. For army training I was assigned to the 4th battery for two months.

I managed well during my days in national service – I was used to managing and overcoming life’s difficulties and was never punished. When I returned from the practical training, I was sent to supply section where all the bookkeepers shared a separated room. At the headquarters my superior was a bookkeeper, Lozberg, who was single and a musician. He sang and played the violin and was very kind to me; he called me Zonin, after his son. After a couple months I ordered a good army uniform to be made in the same style as an officer’s. I had saved a lot of money in my last year at work before the national service. I had about 700 Lati, which I had put in the government bank. A good suit cost 100 Lati, and the boots 20 Lati. I wore my personal uniform only to go to balls or when I went on holidays.

Lozberg warned me not to associate with common girls as it was easy to get venereal diseases. He had a wide circle of friends because he lived in Jekabplis, which was on the other side of Daugava river. At that time there was no bridge so the river had to be crossed by raft, which was fun. Jekabplis was a town while Krustpils was only a village; one street with buildings each side, mostly populated with Jews. In towns where the army training was based there was a large population of prostitutes who went with the ordinary soldiers. Many times, Lozberg invited me to go to parties with him: “Zonin, put on your fancy uniform and come with me to the party in Jekabpils.” There he usually introduced me to teachers, university students, and other better-class girls. He was proud to show me off, to show that he had such an able assistant.
