It was winter – February – when I got a notice that the only job at the moment was at Annemieka factory in the Tukums district near Lestene and Rumbus hotel. The nearest town was Dobele, about twelve kilometres away. I was a cream collection manager. The actual cream collective was in the Rumbus hotel until the factory could be opened. It was a rough pub at a crossroads’ stopover and it was built like the old manor houses from split stone. The land around was very flat. The farms were all very prosperous and the farmers conceited. The pub had been allocated to a blacksmith who had lived and worked there. He was very well-off and owned another farm as well. His name was Barons and he had two daughters and a son. The oldest daughter was married and the son was in national service. So, there were only four of us in the large building: myself, the two parents, and their daughter Guste who was a 25-year-old, slim blonde. At first the room I used was on the street side; very light, newly painted and with a built-in stove so that I could do my own cooking. As it was winter I was keeping my room nice and warm. Guste was coming in to warm herself and this led to some kissing until we found ourselves in bed.

I had only taken this job as a temporary one because the pay was not very good and my work was only six hours. I was looking for a job as an assistant in a large factory with many employees so that I would not be so lonely. I could not manage a factory myself yet as I needed more experience and had to be 21-years-old. Also, my relationship with Guste was getting a bit serious so I thought it would be best to get away. She was so much in love that she spent all the time being near me and in my room.
